Doodle Dog Breeder Web App

Please checkout the live demo here: http://doodle-2-doodle-2.1d35.starter-us-east-1.openshiftapps.com/

This app is under construction and changing almost daily. I've got the bare bones up to share with others and get feedback. Features yet to come include:

- <s>Map of US with clickable States</s>
- <s>Better UX and aesthetic design</s>
- Pictures of dog breeds
- Breed 'Parents' to show what breeds contributed to the doodle mix
- Breeder vs. Admin login
- Blog, resources links

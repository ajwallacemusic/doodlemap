Doodle Dog Breeder Web App

This app is under construction and changing almost daily. I've got the bare bones up to share with others and get feedback. Features yet to come include:

- Map of US with clickable States
- Pictures of dog breeds
- Breed 'Parents' to show what breeds contributed to the doodle mix
- Breeder vs. Admin login
- Better UX and aesthetic design
